 * \page doxypage_input_particles
 *
 * <h3>How the particles file is used</h3>
 * The particles available to SMASH are defined in the *input/particles.txt*
 * file. The content of this file is internally copied by CMake to the
 * ***build*** directory when running the `cmake` command **for the first time**
 * to set up SMASH. If you want to modify the particles file, you are encouraged
 * to copy the provided one to a wished location, which has then to be passed to
 * SMASH via the `-p` option. For example, assuming to have a
 * *custom_particles.txt* file in the ***build*** folder, the SMASH executable
 * can be run from there and instructed to use the own particles file via
 * ```console
 * ./smash -p custom_particles.txt
 * ```
 *
 * <h3>The particle file format</h3>
 * %Particles are specified as a table with particles properties in different
 * columns, which may be separated by an arbitrary number of spaces:
 * ```
 * <name> <mass in GeV> <width in GeV> <parity> <PDG codes>
 * ```
 * The name has to be a unique UTF-8 string. Conventionally, unicode names are
 * used in SMASH to make the file more readable and generate prettier output. It
 * is possible to only specify the isospin multiplet and SMASH will fill in the
 * properties of the components of the multiplet assuming isospin symmetry. The
 * names generated this way will have the charges appended to the multiplet name
 * using the unicode characters `⁻`, `⁰` and `⁺`. This is appropriate for almost
 * all particles. Anti particles do not have to be specified explicitly.
 *
 * The pole mass and the on-shell width of the particle or multiplet have to be
 * specified as floating point numbers in GeV.
 *
 * The parity has to be either `+` or `-`.
 *
 * The PDG codes are following the [numbering
 * scheme](http://pdg.lbl.gov/2018/mcdata/mc_particle_id_contents.html)
 * specified by the PDG, which depends on the quantum numbers of the particles.
 * For SMASH, it is important that the quark content in the PDG code is
 * correctly specified. Other than that, deviations from the numbering scheme
 * have no effect in SMASH. If the name represents a multiplet, there has to be
 * a PDG code for all multiplet members, except for anti particles.
 *
 * For example, to define all three pions (π⁻, π⁰, π⁺), it is sufficient to
 * specify the π multiplet using the following line in *particles.txt*, where
 * the 4th column contains the PDG number of the neutral and the 5th PDG number
 * of the charged state:
 * ```
 * π  0.138  7.7e-9  111  211
 * ```
 *
 * It is also possible to only specify a specific member of the multiplet. In
 * this case, the charge has to be given as a suffix in the name using the UTF-8
 * unicode characters `⁻`, `⁰` and `⁺`. For example, the properties of the
 * electron can be specified like this:
 * ```
 * e⁻  0.000511  0  11
 * ```
 *
 * Comments can be added to the particles file using the `#` character.
 * Everything after `#` until the end of the line is ignored.
 *
 * <hr>
 * \attention
 * -# If you specify an incorrect value, SMASH will print an error similar to
 *    the following:
 *    ```
 *    Failed to convert the input string to the expected data types.
 *    ```
 * -# SMASH validates (up to some small numeric precision) the mass of some
 *    particles (e.g. N, π, K, ω, Δ, D). Therefore, totally nonphysical mass
 *    values cannot be used and SMASH will abort with a message error like e.g.
 *    the following
 *    ```
 *    Nucleon mass in input file different from 0.938000
 *    ```
 *    if a mass discrepancy for one of the validated particle is detected. This
 *    constraint is due to internal assumptions in SMASH and is needed to
 *    guarantee the correctness of the results. If you really need to use SMASH
 *    with nonphysical mass values, feel free to contact us or open an issue.
 * -# Related to the previous point, it is important to mention that all hadrons
 *    belonging to the same isospin multiplet must have the same mass and this
 *    is enforced by SMASH, which will fail otherwise. Feel free to get in touch
 *    with us, if this restriction represents a problem for you.
 * -# Some reactions in SMASH are parametrized and require specific particles in
 *    the final state. When such a reaction happens and the required particle is
 *    not defined, SMASH will crash.
 * -# When running a box simulation in which detailed balance is expected to be
 *    conserved, the particles file will need to be modified. See \ref
 *    modi_box_usage_remark "this remark about the box modus" for further
 *    information.

/*!\Userguide
 * \page doxypage_input_decaymodes
 *
 * All possible decays and resonance formations in SMASH are provided by the
 * `decaymodes.txt` file, which is
 * located in '$SMASH_SRC_DIRECTORY/input'. If you want to modify and use this
 * file to set up SMASH, execute
 * ```
 * ./smash -d $SMASH_SRC_DIRECTORY/input/decaymodes.txt
 * ```
 * in the '$SMASH_SRC_DIRECTORY/build' directory. \n
 *
 * The decaymodes are formatted in blocks of the following format:
 * ```
 * <name of decaying particle>
 * <branching ratio> <angular momentum L> <names of decay products>
 * <branching ratio> <angular momentum L> <names of decay products>
 * ...
 * ```
 * The blocks have to be separated by at least one empty line.
 *
 * The names have to be the ones defined in *particles.txt* (see \ref
 * doxypage_input_particles). If multiplet names are used, the other branching
 * ratios are generated by SMASH assuming isospin symmetry. Note that currently
 * decay channels can only be specified for whole multiplets; individual
 * particles can however still be used in a decay channel as specific daughters.
 *
 * The branching ratios are given as a floating point number. If the branching
 * ratios in one block do not add up to 1, they are automatically normalized by
 * SMASH.
 *
 * The angular momentum of the decay channel has to be specified as an integer.
 *
 * The names of two or three decay products have to be given for each channel.
 * Note that the SMASH defaults avoid three-body decays, because they break
 * detailed balance due to the lack of 3-to-1 reactions in SMASH.
 *
 * For example, the following lines are enough to specify all possible decays of
 * the N(1440) resonance multiplet:
 * ```
 * N(1440)
 * 0.60   1  N π
 * 0.24   1  Δ π
 * 0.16   0  N σ
 * ```
 * For decays violating isospin symmetry, it is possible to specify the members
 * of the multiplets in the final state explicitely:
 * ```
 * φ
 * 0.489   1  K⁺ K̅⁻
 * 0.342   1  K⁰ K̅⁰
 * ```
 *
 * It is possible to add comments to `decaymodes.txt` using the `#` character.
 * Everything after `#` until the end of the line is ignored.
 *
 * Note that SMASH has an internal width cut-off (currently 10 keV), below which
 * particles cannot decay, even if decays are specified in `decaymodes.txt`.
 * This only changes when Include_Weak_And_EM_Decays_At_The_End is enabled, then
 * all decays are considered in the final decays, no matter their decay width .
 *
 * Note further, that the decaymodes file will need to be modified when running
 * a box simulation in which detailed balance is expected to be conserved. See
 * \ref doxypage_input_conf_modi_box for further information.

/**
 * Interface to the SMASH configuration files.
 *
 * The configuration is created from a %YAML file and then stores a nested map
 * of maps (normally a tree, but %YAML allows it to be cyclic - even though we
 * don't want that feature). Since the resource owned by the object is a
 * \c YAML::Node that handle memory in a similar way as a pointer does, it is
 * forbidden (nor should it be needed) to copy instances of this class, while
 * moving is fine (see special members documentation for more information).
 *
 * The typical usage of a Configuration is to create it, consume (i.e.
 * <tt>take</tt>) all its values and let it being destructed. Since this is the
 * contact point with SMASH input file, the class is meant to be strict in its
 * usage, so that it is possible to help the inexpert user, who might being
 * using a wrong input file and/or e.g. specify an unused key hoping in an
 * effect that indeed does not occur. Therefore, it is imposed that <b>all keys
 * must be parsed before an instance gets destroyed</b>. If this is not the
 * case, an exception will be thrown.
 *
 * For the typical usage in SMASH one needs to read the value once. In that
 * case, use the Configuration::take function, for example:
 * \code
 * double sigma = config.take({"General", "SIGMA"});
 * \endcode
 * Note the curly braces in the function call. It is a \c std::initializer_list
 * of strings. This allows an arbitrary nesting depth via the same function. But
 * as a consequence the keys must all be given as constant strings at compile
 * time.
 *
 * The opposite operation of \c take is the Configuration::set_value method,
 * which has a similar syntax, but needs the new value to be assigned, e.g.
 * \code
 * config.set_value({"General", "SIGMA"}, 3.1415);
 * \endcode
 *
 * If you need to delegate parsing of a section to some object, you can use the
 * Configuration::extract_sub_configuration method, which is taking a full
 * section and returning a new, distinct Configuration instance.
 *
 * Last but not least, the Configuration::validate method is used by SMASH to
 * check that all given keys are allowed in the present version of the codebase.
 * This is achieved by querying the "database" InputKeys class.
 *
 * \attention As the Configuration is implemented, it does not make sense in
 * practice to have constant instances, because their keys could not be taken
 * and their destruction would lead to an exception being thrown. However, it
 * still makes perfectly sense to have constant methods (think e.g. of a
 * <tt>const %Configuration&</tt> being passed to a function).

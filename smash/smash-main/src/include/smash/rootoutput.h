 *
 * \brief SMASH output to ROOT file
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * SMASH supports ROOT output as an option (see http://root.cern.ch).
 * The ROOT framework needs to be installed before building SMASH, otherwise
 * ROOT support will be disabled.
 *
 * This class produces file Particles.root, which contains a
 * ROOT TTree. TTree contains information about particles from all SMASH events
 * comprising a simulation.
 * Output is happening in blocks. All particles in a block
 * are at the same time and in the same event. However, it is possible that
 * different blocks are at the same time and from the same event.
 * Particle information is stored in TBranches.
 * For each particle characteristic there is a separate branch.
 * Currently these are t,x,y,z (coordinates), p0,px,py,pz (4-momentum),
 * pdgcode - PDG code of the particle, characterizing its type,
 * charge - electric charge of the particle,
 * ev - event number in a given block,
 * tcounter - number of the output block in a given event,
 * npart - number of particles in the block,
 * test_p - number of testpartciles per particle,
 * modus_l - modus length,
 * current_t - time associated with the output block, in fm,
 * impact_b - impact parameter of the event,
 * empty_event - whether there was no interaction between the projectile and
 * the target,
 * E_kinetic_tot - total kinetic energy in the system,
 * E_fields_tot - total mean field energy * test_p,
 * E_total - sum of E_kinetic_tot and E_fields_tot.
 *
 * This class also produces file Collisions.root, organized in the same way,
 * with a few additional fields:
 * nin and nout - characterize number of incoming and outgoing particles in the
 * reaction, with nin + nout = npart,
 * weight - an action weight, whose meaning depends on the type of action: For
 * collisions it is the total cross section, for decays it is the total decay
 * width and for dilepton decays it is the shining weight.
 *
 * If "Collisions:" section is present, then in addition to a file
 * Particles.root with particles TTree, another file Collisions.root is
 * created. It contains information about each collision, written as one leaf:
 * nin, nout - number of incoming and outgoing particles, ev - event number,
 * weight - total weight of the collision (wgt), partial_weight - partial
 * weight of the collision (par_wgt), (t,x,y,z),
 * (p0,px,py,pz) - arrays of dimension nin+nout
 * that contain coordinates and momenta.
